Trader Behavior vs. Market Sentiment Analysis

This project analyzes how Bitcoin trader performance changes under different market sentiment conditions (Fear vs. Greed). By combining a sentiment dataset with historical trader data, we uncover insights that drive smarter trading strategies.

Datasets Used
- **Hyperliquid Historical Trader Data**
- **Fear-Greed Index (Sentiment Classification)**

Key Findings
Traders were **slightly more profitable during Greed** (41.3%) than Fear (40.8%)
However, **losses were larger and overtrading more common** in Greed
Traders showed **more discipline during Fear**, paying higher fees for fewer but better trades

 Strategy Recommendations
- Limit trading frequency during Greed phases to avoid emotional overtrading
- Use tighter stop-losses in Greed to reduce large losses
- Stay selective and cautious in Fear â€” data shows this leads to better outcomes
